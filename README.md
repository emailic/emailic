### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my account! Even though I've been in the fields of machine learning and data science for a while now, I'm still only learning all the ways to use Github. In the months to come I'd like to start contributing more to the open source, and understand well the dynamics and the potenital of this platform. Here's something little about me:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a computer vision project: I'm deploying YOLOv5 by Ultralytics on a microplastics dataset in order to automatically count and classify the particles!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to contribute more to the Github community. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning  and data science projects. I've been in the field for about 3 years now.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning how to contribute to open source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about computer vision, NLP, dimensinality reduction, time series, classification and clustering algorithms, pandas, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, SQL...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: preferably by email which you can find in my profile info :) I'm also active on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ema-ilic/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love doing calisthenics!
